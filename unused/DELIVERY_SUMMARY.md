## 💡 Recommendations

### For Your Warehouse

**I recommend starting with React Native** because:

1. ✅ **Larger developer pool** - Easier to find JavaScript developers
2. ✅ **Mature ecosystem** - More packages and resources
3. ✅ **Team familiarity** - Most developers know JavaScript
4. ✅ **Smaller app size** - ~12MB vs ~18MB
5. ✅ **Web integration** - Easier to add web version later

**However, Flutter is excellent if:**
- Performance is absolutely critical
- You want the smallest codebase
- Team can learn Dart quickly
- You need desktop apps later

**Both are production-ready - you can't go wrong!**
